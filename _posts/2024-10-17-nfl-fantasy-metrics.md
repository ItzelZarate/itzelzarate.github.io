## NFL Fantasy Metrics

I've always been curious about the NFL. I remember spending many Sunday afternoons watching games with my dad, who was a huge fan of the Green Bay Packers and Pittsburgh Steelers. At the time, I thought the game was pretty complex and couldn't really grasp all the details. But in the last few years, I've gotten back in touch with the sport as my boyfriend enjoys playing NFL Fantasy Team and watching NFL in general, and now there's a special edition game in Germany.

NFL Fantasy is in a nutshell a game where you can create leagues with friends and build your own team to compete against each other. The challenge is knowing which players to draft, and that decision can be based on a variety of variables - or sometimes just gut instinct. In this post, I've put together a simple analysis of the metrics available in the latest NFL Fantasy data.

Each player in NFL Fantasy is assigned fantasy points. These points are calculated using specific formulas that can vary depending on the league you're in. In theory, the higher the fantasy points, the better the player's recent performance. The goal of my analysis is to determine which metrics contribute to a player earning more fantasy points. I've also calculated some additional metrics that can help you decide if a player is worth adding to your roster. Keep in mind that this is a very simple analysis that only includes historical metrics for the current season, and you will usually need to consider a number of external factors to make a decision on your player choices.
