Hi, I’m Itzel Zarate, and I’m originally from Mexico. A little while ago, I decided to embark on the adventure of getting a Master's degree in Germany. I wanted to learn more about German culture and gain a new perspective on life.

I recently graduated with a Master's degree in Information and Communication Technology at FAU Erlangen. During my studies, I had the opportunity to work with amazing teams and experts in the field of data science, where I developed AI-based solutions for various projects in the automotive and financial sectors.

Before that, I worked in the telecommunications industry, supporting the planning of the 5G technology upgrade for over 300 sites in the US and Canada. It was a fantastic experience collaborating with project managers, construction crews, and field technicians, all while being part of the launch of one of the latest telecom technologies and helping people stay connected.

Now, I’m on the lookout for the perfect opportunity to dive deeper into data science. In the meantime, I’m continuing to learn relevant technologies, working on personal projects, and, of course, polishing my German skills.
