Hi, I'm Itzel. I am originally from Mexico, but I decided to embark on the adventure of getting a Master's degree in Germany, learning about German culture and opening myself up to a new perspective on life.

I recently graduated with a Master's degree in Information and Communication Technology from FAU Erlangen. And in the last few years, I had the opportunity to work with amazing teams and experts in the field of data science, where I developed AI-based solutions for various use cases in the automotive and financial sectors.

Previously, I worked in the telecommunications sector where I planned the 5G technology upgrade of more than 300 sites in the US and Canada together with project managers, construction managers and field technicians. This experience was rewarding because I knew I was part of the release of one of the latest telecommunications technologies and I was helping people get connected.
